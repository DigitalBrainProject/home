At the 2025 Japan Neuroscience Society Meeting, we are organizing [three symposia (1S07m, 2S05m, 2S05a)](https://neuroscience2025.jnss.org/en/program.html#p05) related to the ‘Digital Brain’ by inviting researchers from around the world.  

On the day before the main meeting, we will hold a satellite symposium to bring together speakers from the three symposia and to discuss how to connect different data and models for scientific discoveries and applications. Each session starts with short presentations by the speakers and continues into discussions by all the participants.
