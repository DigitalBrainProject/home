# BM2 Digital Brain Project

Following the conclusion of the Brain/MINDS project (2014-2024), a new six-year program Multidisciplinary Frontier Brain and Neuroscience Discoveries ([Brain/MINDS 2.0](https://brainminds.jp/en)) has started.

A remarkable feature of this program is that the Digital Brain 「デジタル脳」plays a central role in integrating structural and dynamic brain data from multiple species for understanding brain functions and tackling neuropsychiatric disorders.

## Events

To facilitate discussions about how to build and to utilize digital brains, we organize [*Digital Brain Seminars*](https://boatneck-weeder-7b7.notion.site/Digital-Brain-Seminar-90cc94badac64d32a281cba4245ed66d).  

Most of the talks are available on the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@kennakae2779).

On September 19-21, 2024, we organized [Digital Brain Workshop](https://boatneck-weeder-7b7.notion.site/Digtal-Brain-Workshop-131a68936dda4867a88fedd25dfaac92) in collaboration with [Institute of Mathematics for Industry, Kyoshu University](https://www.imi.kyushu-u.ac.jp/en/)

## Research positions

[OIST Neural Computation Unit](https://groups.oist.jp/ncu) (prof. Kenji Doya) will take a leading role in developing the software tools for constructing digital brains and their use cases for understanding brain functions, such as reinforcement learning and Bayesian inference, and prediction, intervention, and prevention of neuropsychiatric disorders.

This ambitious project requires fresh talents from math, computation, AI and brain sciences, as well as broad international collaborations. We have postdoc and technical positions available.
