# [Digital Brain Project](https://digitalbrainproject.github.io/home/)

Following the conclusion of the [Brain/MINDS project](https://bm1.brainminds.jp/en/) (2014-2024), a new six-year program Multidisciplinary Frontier Brain and Neuroscience Discoveries ([Brain/MINDS 2.0](https://brainminds.jp/en)) has started.

A remarkable feature of this program is that the **Digital Brain** plays a central role in integrating structural and dynamic brain data from multiple species for understanding brain functions and tackling neuropsychiatric disorders.

## Forthcoming Events

* To facilitate discussions about how to build and to utilize digital brains, we organize [**Digital Brain Seminars**](https://digitalbrainproject.github.io/seminar/).
Most of the talks are available on the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@kennakae2779/videos).

## Core Organization

RIKEN and seven partner institutions including OIST, ATR and Kyoto University were selected as the [Core Organization](https://brainminds.jp/en/core). The Group 4 is in charge of Digital Brain Development with the following PIs.

* Shin Ishii, Kyoto University
* Henrik Skibbe, RIKEN CBS
* Saori Tanaka, ATR
* Kenji Doya, OIST (group head)
* Jun Igarashi, RIKEN AICS
* Takuya Isomura, RIKEN CBS (group subhead)
