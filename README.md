# [Digital Brain Project](https://digitalbrainproject.github.io/home/)

Following the conclusion of the [Brain/MINDS project](https://bm1.brainminds.jp/en/) (2014-2024), a new six-year program Multidisciplinary Frontier Brain and Neuroscience Discoveries ([Brain/MINDS 2.0](https://brainminds.jp/en)) has started.

A remarkable feature of this program is that the **Digital Brain** plays a central role in integrating structural and dynamic brain data from multiple species for understanding brain functions and tackling neuropsychiatric disorders.

## Events

* To facilitate discussions about how to build and to utilize digital brains, we organize [**Digital Brain Seminars**](https://digitalbrainproject.github.io/seminar/).
Most of the talks are available on the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@kennakae2779/videos).

* On July 23, 2025, we will organize a [**Satellite Symposium: Connecting Digital Brains Across the World**](https://digitalbrainproject.github.io/home/JNS2025satellite.html) for the Japan Neuroscience Society meeting in Toki Messe, Niigata.

* On July 24 and 25, 2025, we will organize [**Three Symposia on the Digital Brain**](https://digitalbrainproject.github.io/home/JNS2025symposia.html) during the Japan Neuroscience Society meeting in Toki Messe, Niigata.

* On September 19-21, 2024, we organized [**Digital Brain Workshop**](https://boatneck-weeder-7b7.notion.site/Digtal-Brain-Workshop-131a68936dda4867a88fedd25dfaac92) in collaboration with [Institute of Mathematics for Industry, Kyoshu University](https://www.imi.kyushu-u.ac.jp/en/)

## Core Organization

RIKEN and seven partner institutions including OIST, ATR and Kyoto University were selected as the [Core Organization](https://brainminds.jp/en/core). The Group 4 is in charge of Digital Brain Development with the following PIs.

* Shin Ishii, Kyoto University
* Henrik Skibbe, RIKEN CBS
* Saori Tanaka, ATR
* Kenji Doya, OIST (group head)
* Jun Igarashi, RIKEN AICS
* Takuya Isomura, RIKEN CBS (group subhead)

## Research positions

[OIST Neural Computation Unit](https://groups.oist.jp/ncu) (prof. Kenji Doya) will take a leading role in developing the software tools for constructing digital brains and their use cases for understanding brain functions, such as reinforcement learning and Bayesian inference, and prediction, intervention, and prevention of neuropsychiatric disorders.

This ambitious project requires fresh talents from math, computation, AI and brain sciences, as well as broad international collaborations. We have postdoc and technical positions available.
